This project seeks to illuminate the lives and experiences of the more than 100 Black students who enrolled at Iowa State College between its founding and 1950 and map their residences while in school. The names and lives of these students deserve to be known as an important part of the history of Iowa State just as are the names “Carver” and “Trice.” Impressive Black Iowa Staters span the decades of the 1890s and early part of the twentieth century, and their stories merit recognition.

## Black students at ISC

Since its founding in 1858 as Iowa Agricultural College & Model Farm, Iowa State University has allowed Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) to enroll as students. Iowa State’s first Black student, George Washington Carver, enrolled in classes in 1891. At that time, the question of where Black students could live while enrolled at the college became a concern, but it was left largely unaddressed by the institution until after World War II. Prior to that time, Black students at Iowa State College (ISC) were kept from rooming on campus by an unwritten policy that required Black students to room together. This requirement was difficult to meet when so few Black students attended the college at any given time.

Just how many Black students, both American and international, enrolled at Iowa State at any given time is an open question. As late as 1926, ISC had only 13 Black students registered during the regular session and had just graduated its first Black woman, Willa Juanita Ewing, according to The Crisis: A Record of the Darker Races (“A Record,” 1926). Ewing, writing to her degree-granting department, told readers of the “Horticultural Annual Newsletter” of 1937 that “At Ames what few colored people live there are apt to think thirty or forty colored students coming there to school are an awfully lot of people” and that “forty or even fifty” enrolled each summer in classes, many more than the 13 during her senior year (n.p.). Yet, most people, when pressed, are likely to know of only two Black Iowa State students: George Washington Carver and John “Jack” Trice.

### Student biographies

The biographies of students included on this WordPress site are not a comprehensive collection, but a work in progress. New names of students are surfacing regularly as research continues. Ultimately, the project will illuminate who the Black students at ISC were, what their experiences were while in Ames, and what contributions they made after leaving Iowa State.

### Student residences

The housing situation of most Black students at Iowa State in the years before it became a university also remains unstudied in any systematic way. The ESRI Story Map linked into this site is an initial step toward addressing that research gap. For some students included among the biographies, no record of their in-session residence has been found to date. The map, like the project itself, is a work under construction, as we add more information on the students’ lives.

## A note about terms

Throughout this site, you will find the terms “Negro” and “Colored” used in quoted material and in the names of many Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). These terms are meant to accurately reflect the words of the sources and the names of the HBCUs at the time the ISC students had connections to those institutions. When referring to Iowa State graduates or enrollees and their experiences at HBCUs, the site reflects the names of the institutions appropriate to the time the ISC grads were active there. The term “Black” is used more often than “African American” in recognition of the Black ISC students from outside the country.
